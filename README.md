# Javascript snippets for VCV Rack

This is a collection of simple scripts I plan to use embedded in my VCV Rack modules via QuickJS. 

This mess is not usable as-is, it's just a collection of snippets implemented the most lazy way possible. You have to fiddle around a bit with a REPL or console.log statements to test them.

For simplicity, the scripts are copied manually as strings in the C++ files.
